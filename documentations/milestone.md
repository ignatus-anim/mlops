## 2. Automated Model Training & Validation
| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Data preprocessing & validation | **In-Progress** | Basic preprocessing in DAG; explicit validation checks still needed. |
| Recurring training jobs | **Done** | Airflow DAG schedules training; dynamic experiment naming. |
| Metric logging | **Done** | R², etc., logged to MLflow; best-model logic implemented. |
| Store trained model artifacts | **Done** | Saved to S3 & MLflow artifacts. |

## 3. A/B Testing Infrastructure
| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Traffic splitter / LB config | **Done** | Nginx router with 80/20 traffic split between prod/candidate. |
| Logging live predictions & ground truth | **Done** | PostgreSQL logging with variant tracking, user feedback system. |
| A/B performance comparison script | **Done** | `/api/metrics` endpoint + `evaluate_ab_dag.py` for automated comparison. |

## 4. Automated Rollbacks
| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Threshold rules & rollback script | **Done** | `evaluate_ab_dag.py` with composite scoring and promotion/rollback logic. |
| Alerting (Slack / email) | **To-Do** | Rollback logic exists but notifications not implemented. |
| Deployment scripts with rollback | **Done** | Automated model promotion with container restarts via Docker Compose. |

## 5. Inference API
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| RESTful endpoints | **Done** | 6 endpoints: predict, locations, health, metrics, feedback, logs. |
| Health-check endpoint | **Done** | `/api/health` with system metrics and database connectivity. |
| Batch predictions support | **To-Do** | Currently single-row only. |
| Dynamic model version loading | **Done** | Automatic BO/CO version detection from S3 with fallback logic. |
| Observability / logging | **Done** | Comprehensive logging, Prometheus metrics, performance tracking. |

## 6. Model Versioning & Experiment Tracking (Bonus)
| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| MLflow tracking | **Done** | Experiments auto-created per run with S3 artifact storage. |
| Model registry / promotion workflow | **Done** | Custom BO/CO versioning system with automated promotion via `evaluate_ab_dag.py`. |

## 7. Testing & Validation
| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests (train, inference) | **Done** | 4/4 unit tests passing - version utils, basic functions. |
| Integration tests (API) | **Done** | 7/7 API endpoint tests passing - all endpoints validated. |
| Load tests | **Done** | Locust framework implemented with realistic user scenarios. |
| CI pipeline | **Done** | GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing before deployment. |

## 8. Documentation & House-keeping
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| README explaining run/deploy steps | **In-Progress** | Some docs in comments; need full README. |
| .gitignore | **Done** | Added comprehensive ignore rules. |
| requirements.txt / env files | **Done** | `.env` in place; Python deps managed inside Dockerfiles. |

## Current Status Summary
**✅ COMPLETED (90% of core requirements):**
- Complete MLOps pipeline with automated training, A/B testing, and rollbacks
- Comprehensive testing suite (11/11 tests passing)
- Production monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- Full inference API with 6 endpoints
- Model versioning and experiment tracking

**⚠️ REMAINING (10% - production hardening):**
